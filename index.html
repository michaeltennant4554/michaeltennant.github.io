 <h3> Fortnite Battle Royale Review </h3>

<p> Fotnite have added their own battle royale mode recently which so far has had really positive reviews so far people are saying that it is alot like Player Unknowns Battle grounds. </p>
 <p> You jump out of a bus then land and look for loot just like Battle Roayle </p>

 <p> The way they made the Battle Royale is really good becasue they made it there own by adding building and how much Damage you do but it is fairly
  obvious on which guns are better thern others.</p>
 <p> I would give Fortnites Battle Royale a 7.5/10 as it gives a fun time for friends and to win!!! </p>
